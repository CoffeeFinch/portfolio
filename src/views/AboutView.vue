    <p id="intro">That's me up there, in that drawing. I did that myself. I like to do self portraits because, if they turn out badly, you aren't disappointing anyone but yourself. <br><br> So, a little about me. My name is Will Gainsborough, as you may have surmised. I live in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania with my incredible wife and our three cats. <br><br> I've had a very diverse career path. I've been a podcaster, marketing specialist, professional wrestler, video editor, improv comedian, sound engineer, library archivist, line cook, graphic designer, producer and project manager. Those were just the things I did for money. <br><br> In my free time, I like to make strange art, make music, write poetry and novels, and cook elaborate things to varying degrees of success. And then there's coding. <br><br>In early 2022, I went through the software development bootcamp Tech Elevator. It was one of the best decisions of my life. I met people there that I will consider friends for the remainder of my life, but I also found the thing that I should have been doing the entire time: coding. I adore coding. As an artist, I love making 'something' where previously there had been 'nothing'. Software development has become a new and powerful brush in my kit, so to speak. It is the perfect expression of my favorite maxim, "Trust The Process". It is art and logic and problem solving all wrapped into one, and those are three of my boldest keywords. Just like painting, sculpting and cooking, I will be happily coding for the rest of my life.  </p>
